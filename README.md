# TriviaGame

### The goal of this project is to create:
A trivia game that uses JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. 
And make sure: 
•	The layout of this app has valid HTML and stylish CSS.
•	to create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).
•	The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 
•	The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
•	Not to let the player pick more than one answer per question.
•	Remember to include a countdown timer.

The game will ask several trivia questions in a multiple choice or true false format

Users will be immidiately faced with the 1st question and a timer that counts down. 
They can click on the possible answers (with a radio button)... or click answer and faced with new question.
The game ends when the time runs out

When time is up, the user will get a game end screen... showing them their stats and be given a chance to restart the quiz. 
stats: number of questions players answered, didn't answer, got correct, got incorrect.
